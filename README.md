## API Change
Starting 2025, the data provider for this module (ergast) is off line. Jolpi.ca provides a new api. In the next months this module will be altered.
Not all data, e.q. the race schedule, is available at the endpoint yet. 
9 jan 2025: First race schedule data is getting to the mirror. Fixed a bug on handling missing time in data [brach devjan2025], will merge into master in next days. 

## Example

![Example screenshot](screenshot.png)

### The module displays the current Formula 1 schedule and standings from the selected season with the following information

- The flag for the driver or constructor.
- The drivers name (when the drivers standings are displayed).
- The constructor name.
- The current points total.
- The current number of wins.
- the schedule for the current race weekend, including free practice, sprint, quali and race time
- the track layout for the current race weekend
- the name and time for the race after this weekend
- constructor icon logos and higher resolution flags

### In addition you can configure the following options

- Which season to display the standings for `season`
- Whether to show the drivers `DRIVER` or constructors `CONSTRUCTOR` standings, Use `showStanding`, there are also modes for `BOTH` and `MIX`. With `BOTH` first driver and than constructor standings are shown in a table. With MIX the driver and constructor are shown in the same space, but after each other in time. Use `NONE` to show no standings.
- How many drivers/constructors to display in the standings table `maxRowsDriver` or `maxRowsConstructor`
- If you have a favourite driver/constructor not in "how many" range, you can add a `fanDriverCode` or `fanConstructorCode`. This driver and/or constructor is added to the standing.

- Whether to show the race weeking timing table schedule. `showSchedule`
- Whether to show the schedule without the next race information. `showNextRace`

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianperrin/MMM-Formula1
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Formula1
npm install --production
```

Configure the module in your `config/config.js` file.

## Updating

If you want to update your MMM-Formula1 module to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your MMM-Formula1 module folder and type the following command:

```bash
git pull
```

(Re)install dependencies.

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Formula1
npm install --production
```

If you haven't changed the modules, this should work without any problems.
Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, git pull should be possible.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-Formula1",
    position: "top_right",
    header: "Formula 1",
    config: {
      // Optional configuration options - see https://github.com/73cirdan/MMM-Formula1#configuration-options

## Thanks

- ianperrins first version which led to this version. Major changes:
  - removed f1api from the package.json and rewrote node_helper
  - removed dev tools for now, will learn it and apply it in the future ;-)
  - rewrote nunjucks template to support different display options
  - removed ical dependency and possibility to use magicmirror calendar. The default upcomming weekend and next race are shown in what used to be the standing module
  - updated flags css
- track layouts by F1laps for the track vectors
  - found here on github
  - rotated some layout to use spcae more efficient (portrait layout)
  - thickened some lines
  - made a unicolor version for grayscale mode
- ergast api for the data
  - btw ergast announced to deprecate the api end of 2024. There is an alternative free api that will add schedule and standings to their api early in 2024.
